Modifying Published Content
***************************
 
When you set a Unit to Public, that content appears on edX or Edge when you
view the content as an instructor. If the release date has passed, the
content is also visible to students.
 
 
If you want to modify content after it has been set to Public, you must
create a draft. The draft does not appear on edX or Edge. However, the draft
does appear when you view your content in Preview mode.
 
 
To create a draft, open the Unit that you want. Note that no **Edit** button
appears on the page for that Unit, and you cannot make changes to the Unit.
